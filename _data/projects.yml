- project: AI/ML-based Prediction and Design Optimization of Signal Integrity on SSD High-speed Host Interface Channel 
  role: sponsered by Samsung D.S 
  duration: 2021 &mdash; Now
  # url: "#"
  description: Using machine learning technics, we build a fast prediction model of the high-speed host interface, including channel, via, etc. We provide efficient design automation tools based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where the prediction model feeds the reward.
